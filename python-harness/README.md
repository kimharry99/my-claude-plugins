# my-python-harness

Python convention guardrails for Claude Code.

This plugin enforces Python style and architectural rules automatically through two hooks — a session-start context injector and a post-write guardrail — without requiring any explicit slash commands.

## What You Get

- **SessionStart hook** — injects all rules from `rules/` as context at the start of every session, so Claude is always aware of the project conventions
- **PostToolUse guardrail** — validates `.py` files on every Write or Edit tool call and blocks writes that contain violations
- Four built-in rule sets:
  - **oop** — Strict OOP: all functions and non-constant variables must live inside classes
  - **python-style** — Google Python Style Guide (docstrings, naming, imports, line length, type annotations)
  - **test-layout** — Test files must mirror the source tree under `tests/`
  - **test-patterns** — No direct `_protected` access in tests; expose internals via a `_Testable*` subclass

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** with plugin support (`/plugin` command available)
- **bash** — for the hook scripts under `hooks/`
- **jq** — for JSON handling in the PostToolUse guardrail
- **python3** — for AST-based import validation in the guardrail

## Install

Add the marketplace in Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add kimharry99/my-python-harness
```

Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install my-python-harness@my-python-harness
```

Reload plugins:

```bash
/reload-plugins
```

After install, you should see the SessionStart hook fire at the beginning of your next session, injecting all four rule sets as a context reminder. No slash commands are registered — the plugin works silently through hooks.

A quick first run inside any Python project: ask Claude to add a module-level function. The PostToolUse hook will block the write and explain why the OOP rule requires all functions to live inside a class.

## Usage

The plugin runs automatically — no explicit commands are needed.

### SessionStart: rule injection

At the start of every session, `hooks/rule-reminder.sh` reads all `.md` files from the `rules/` directory and injects their content into the session context. Claude receives a formatted reminder of every active rule before any work begins.

### PostToolUse: write guardrail

When Claude uses the Write or Edit tool on a `.py` file, `hooks/check-python-rules.sh` validates the file and blocks the write if any of the following violations are found:

| Check | Applies to | What it catches |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Banned builtins | All `.py` files | Use of `setattr`, `getattr`, or `hasattr` |
| Inline imports | Non-test `.py` files | `import` statements inside functions, methods, or conditionals |

If a violation is detected, Claude receives a block decision with a description of the problem and must fix it before the file can be written. If no violations are found, the hook exits silently and the write proceeds.

Test files (paths matching `*test_*`, `*_test.py`, `*/tests/*`, or `*/test/*`) are exempt from the inline import check.

## How It Works

1. **Session begins** — `rule-reminder.sh` scans `rules/` for all `.md` files, concatenates their content with formatting, and returns an `additionalContext` JSON payload that Claude Code injects into the session prompt.
2. **Claude writes a `.py` file** — `check-python-rules.sh` receives the file path from the tool call, runs the banned-builtin scan and the AST-based inline import check.
3. **Violations found** — the hook returns `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}` with the first violation details, preventing the write.
4. **No violations** — the hook exits with no output and the write proceeds normally.

## Adding a New Rule

1. Create `rules/<name>.md` with a frontmatter header and the rule content:
   ```markdown
   ---
   globs: "*.py"
   description: "One-line description shown in session reminders"
   ---

   # Rule Title

   Rule content here.
   ```
2. The SessionStart hook picks it up automatically on the next session — no other changes needed.
3. To enforce the rule at write time (blocking violations), add a check to `hooks/check-python-rules.sh`.

## Local Development

You can develop and test this plugin against itself — no publish step needed.

```bash
# From a target repo where you want to run reviews:
/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/my-python-harness
/plugin install my-python-harness@my-python-harness
/reload-plugins
```

Then edit files in this repo and run `/reload-plugins` in the target session to pick up the changes.
