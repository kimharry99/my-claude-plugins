# pr-review-analyze

## Pre-flight: identify the PR

Resolve the PR number in this priority order:

1. User-supplied PR number (e.g. `#123` or `123` in the invocation).
2. Current branch: discover via GitHub MCP `*get_pull_request*` or `gh pr view --json number,title -q '[.number,.title]'`.
3. If neither works, ask the user for the PR number.

Also collect the PR title and base branch name.

## Tool discovery

At runtime, scan the available tool list for tools matching the patterns below. Use the first match found for each operation.

| Operation | MCP pattern | gh CLI fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Get PR details | `*get_pull_request*` | `gh pr view <PR> --json number,title,state,baseRefName,headRefName` |
| List reviews | `*list_pull_request_reviews*` or `*get_pull_request_reviews*` | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/reviews` |
| List inline review comments | `*list_pull_request_review_comments*` or `*get_review_comments*` | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments` |

Fetch reviews and inline comments in parallel once the PR number is resolved.

To resolve `{owner}` and `{repo}` for gh CLI fallbacks: `git remote get-url origin` and parse the GitHub URL.

## Severity categorization

Classify each review and comment using these rules, in priority order:

| Signal | Severity |
|---|---|
| Review state is `CHANGES_REQUESTED` | The review verdict is Critical; its individual comments default to Important unless clearly a nit |
| Comment body contains keywords: `bug`, `broken`, `incorrect`, `crash`, `security`, `vulnerability`, `data loss`, `exploit` | Critical |
| Nit indicator prefix in comment body: `nit:`, `nit -`, `minor:`, `optional:`, `s/` | Suggestion |
| Trivial style remark (whitespace, typo in a comment, trivial rename suggestion) | Suggestion |
| All other comments | Important |

Resolved/outdated comments are still included but marked `[resolved]` in the output.

## Output format

Before producing output, read `references/output-format.md` and follow its template verbatim (full report and empty-report variants, verdict rules).

## Rules

- Fetch reviews and inline comments in parallel once the PR number is known.
- Never fabricate or infer reviewer intent beyond what the review text states.
- Include resolved comments but mark them `[resolved]`.
- Every reviewer who submitted at least one review or comment must appear in the Per-Reviewer Summary.
- Do not modify any source files or the PR during analysis.
