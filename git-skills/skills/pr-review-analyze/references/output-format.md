## Notes

- **Overall Verdict** = `REQUEST CHANGES` if any reviewer submitted `CHANGES_REQUESTED` OR any Critical finding exists; otherwise `APPROVE`.
- Resolved/outdated comments are included but marked `[resolved]` after the description.
- If a comment has no file/line (top-level PR comment), use `(general comment)` for the location.
- Every reviewer who submitted at least one review or comment must appear in the Per-Reviewer Summary.
